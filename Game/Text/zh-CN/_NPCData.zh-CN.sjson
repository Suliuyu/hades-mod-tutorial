        Nyx: That you were stripped of your authority is what makes this possible at all. It shall require a significant expenditure of Darkness. Then... the bridge to Chaos may be restored. So that I might travel again to visit them. Will you bring Darkness to the Sigil for me, please? When possible.
        Zagreus: I'll do everything I can. Hey maybe you can put in a request with the House Contractor for me? Make it official, right?

I've learned a lot from you, too, and I cherish our friendship for what it is. Do you... do you think that we could still be friends? Or, is it better that you didn't see me anymore...?

It's really strange for me to call you that, I... when I started here, they told me not to even speak with you, and now, {#DialogueItalicFormat}uh{#PreviousFormat}... here we are...!
        Zagreus: Well, look, if I listened to everything I was told, my life would be a lot different and a lot worse off, I think! So... who cares what anybody says? I enjoy your company.
        Dusa: And I enjoy yours, too! Wasn't long ago that I was just a lonely gorgon head, all by myself in the big Underworld, looking for steady work. And then, I heard about the opening here, in your father's House? Well I got it! It seemed too good to be real. And then, there was you...
        Zagreus: I remember when we first met. You were carrying three bowls for Cerberus and bumped right into me. It all went flying, but you cleaned up half of it before it hit the ground. Then flew away before I got your name. I thought I'd never see you again.
        Dusa: I was {#DialogueItalicFormat}so {#PreviousFormat}embarrassed! Worse... I thought I was done for, here. But, I got another chance! That was your doing, wasn't it? You've been looking out for me, all this time! That's so sweet of you, I... I don't know how to thank you, I... I, I better put this Ambrosia away, for safe keeping, OK?

        Persephone: I couldn't live with myself anymore, down there. After I left Olympus, a long story in itself, I came to be with your father, in the Underworld. It was a shock, to say the least. The others in your father's house were welcoming enough, but... I never felt that I belonged.

        Persephone: I couldn't live with myself anymore, down there. After I left Olympus, a long story in itself, I came to be with your father, in the Underworld. It was a shock, to say the least. The others in your father's house were welcoming enough, but... I never felt that I belonged.

        Persephone: No, no. Your father could be very difficult. Though, he was gentle, with me. Soon enough, we got on fine, better than fine, at times, but... when I was with child... why, I struggled terribly. Because... a child born of surface-dwellers could not live, down there.
        Zagreus: Could not live down there, according to whom, exactly? The Fates?
        Persephone: According to them, yes. According to your father, and to Nyx. Even having heard... I took my chances, anyway. But when you emerged stillborn... it was too much. I fled. I fled, and came to reside here. Above the notice of the Underworld. Beneath the notice of Olympus.

        Zagreus: What a mess. What can we do? The gods of Olympus have all been very good to me, for the most part. I don't feel great about deceiving them. They keep trying to help me escape!
        Persephone: What can we do? We can make peace with them. And let them know the truth. So much of it as they would tolerate. Diplomacy is not your father's strong suit. But I am going to need you two to do exactly as I say. Do you understand?
        Zagreus: Yes, Mother. So what do you intend to do, and how do I fit in?
        Persephone: We're going to invite all of them to a little family gathering! Here. And you shall personally deliver them their invitations, Zagreus.
        Zagreus: Mother, are you serious? So, we're just going to have a bash with them, and they'll just see you after all this time, and be fine with everything?
        Persephone: They certainly shall not be fine with everything. But, Hades and I, we'll be prepared to tell them what they need to hear. Don't worry, I shall do the talking.
        Zagreus: What are you going to say?
        Persephone: Oh, you know! That we met, fell in love, eloped. Had a child. A child who, once grown, sought desperately to reconnect with his extended family. To the chagrin of his grim lord father...
        Zagreus: That's... that's all true. As individual statements, at least.
        Persephone: ...Fortunately, our loving and dutiful son at last persuaded his mother and father to reveal their secretive relationship, and make an effort to rejoin their great family.
        Zagreus: Your mother won't be happy that you left.
        Persephone: I'll deal with her. Perhaps I'll have to visit her and the rest of them from time to time, if that's what it shall take. But I'll be back. I've no choice! Did you know that if you eat the seeds of an Underworld pomegranate, then you cannot leave for one month out of the year, per seed?
        Zagreus: What? No, I never knew that.
        Persephone: Neither do they.
        Zagreus: How soon is this family gathering you have in mind going to take place?
        Persephone: Soon after you invite them all, I hope. Now, go. And trust in me, all right? We have a lot to learn of trust, I think.

        Zagreus: Mother, are you serious? So, we're just going to have a bash with them, and they'll just see you after all this time, and be fine with everything?
        Persephone: They certainly shall not be fine with everything. But, Hades and I, we'll be prepared to tell them what they need to hear. Don't worry, I shall do the talking.
        Zagreus: What are you going to say?
        Persephone: Oh, you know! That we met, fell in love, eloped. Had a child. A child who, once grown, sought desperately to reconnect with his extended family. To the chagrin of his grim lord father...
        Zagreus: That's... that's all true. As individual statements, at least.
        Persephone: ...Fortunately, our loving and dutiful son at last persuaded his mother and father to reveal their secretive relationship, and make an effort to rejoin their great family.
        Zagreus: Your mother won't be happy that you left.
        Persephone: I'll deal with her. Perhaps I'll have to visit her and the rest of them from time to time, if that's what it shall take. But I'll be back. I've no choice! Did you know that if you eat the seeds of an Underworld pomegranate, then you cannot leave for one month out of the year, per seed?
        Zagreus: What? No, I never knew that.
        Persephone: Neither do they.
        Zagreus: How soon is this family gathering you have in mind going to take place?
        Persephone: Soon after you invite them all, I hope. Now, go. And trust in me, all right? We have a lot to learn of trust, I think.

        Zagreus: What a mess. What can we do? The gods of Olympus have all been very good to me, for the most part. I don't feel great about deceiving them. They keep trying to help me escape!
        Persephone: What can we do? We can make peace with them. And let them know the truth. So much of it as they would tolerate. Diplomacy is not your father's strong suit. But I am going to need you two to do exactly as I say. Do you understand?

I remember how hurt I felt when I found out Father lied to me about you. Now we're lying to Olympus. What if they find out? Even if they don't... I don't like it.
        Persephone: Zagreus... I may not be an expert... but here's what I've come to understand about how families work. At least our own. The thing is... how we speak to one another is even more important than the words we use. I think, deep down, everyone in our family knows this.
        Zagreus: You're saying they all knew you weren't being perfectly honest, and went along with it anyway? I guess the pomegranate thing in particular was a bit of a stretch.
        Persephone: The common ground in our family is that we want peace. Besides Ares, though even he would rather the conflict occur elsewhere. That elaborate tale... it's less a deception, and more a concession. A way of saying let's move on from the past, and start anew. No hard feelings.
        Zagreus: You don't have hard feelings? What about Father? What about Demeter?
        Persephone: Well, let's see. My hard feelings are nothing next to the joy of having my son in my life. Your father never imagined his relationship with me could be out in the open. And my mother... she's just glad I'm alive.

        Persephone: You know, the last bottle you gave me brought more pleasant memories than I expected. No telling just how many more of them I've tucked away. Say, would it be all right if I shared this with your father?
